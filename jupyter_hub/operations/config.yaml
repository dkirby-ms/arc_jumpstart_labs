# The resources requested is very important to consider in
# relation to your machine type. If you have a n1-highmem-4 node
# on Google Cloud for example you get 4 cores and 26 GB of
# memory. With the configuration below you would  be able to have
# at most about 50 users per node. This can be reasonable, but it
# may not be, it will depend on your users. Are they mostly
# writing and reading or are they mostly executing code?
